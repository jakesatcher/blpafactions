# Deploying to Railway

BLST, with BLPA Factions built in, runs as one Railway service plus Postgres.
**Nothing secret needs to be configured.** On first start, BLST:
- creates its database tables;
- generates its own secrets;
- switches its everyday queries to a least-privilege database login;
- prints a one-time **setup key** to its log, for creating the first admin.

The same guide and script are in the BLST and blpafactions repos.

Choose one of three ways to deploy:

## 1. Deploy button (one click)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](#make-the-button)

Once you've made the template (below), anyone with the link can deploy a
complete copy in one click: Postgres, BLST and a public address.
1. Click the button.
2. Wait for the deploy to finish.
3. Open the service's **Deploy Logs** and copy the `Setup key: setup-…` line.
4. Open the site → **Admin & setup** → **Set up the admin account**.

### Make the button

You need to do this once, from a Railway account. Either:
- run `npm run railway -- --template` (option 2 below, plus a template), or
- build it in the dashboard:
  1. Go to railway.com → **Workspace → Templates → New Template**.
  2. **Add → Database → PostgreSQL.**
  3. **Add → GitHub Repo →**
     `https://github.com/jakesatcher/BLST/tree/claude/great-bardeen-wfd39q`
     (or `…/BLST` once merged to `main`).
  4. Name the service `blst` and add these **Variables**:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
     PORT=8080
     SEED_DEMO=true
     ```
     Leave out `SEED_DEMO` if new deploys shouldn't get the demo tournament.
  5. **Settings → Networking → Public Networking → HTTP**, port `8080`.
  6. **Create Template**, then copy its URL (`https://railway.com/new/template/XXXX`).

Then replace `#make-the-button` in the button above, and in the README, with
that URL. The template holds no secrets, so it's safe to share.

## 2. One command

1. On railway.com, let Railway's GitHub app read **jakesatcher/BLST**:
   Account → Integrations → GitHub.
2. From either repo, run:
   ```bash
   npm run railway             # or: npm run railway -- --template
   ```
   - You'll be asked to log in to Railway if you aren't already.
   - You don't have to install anything: the script uses the Railway CLI if you
     have it, or runs it through `npx`.

The script:
1. creates the project, the database and the service;
2. waits for BLST to start;
3. prints the setup key.

Open the address it prints → **Admin & setup** → **Set up the admin account**.

## 3. Dashboard, by hand

1. **New Project → Deploy PostgreSQL.**
2. **+ Create → GitHub Repo → jakesatcher/BLST.** Name the service `blst`.
3. Set the variables `DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` and `PORT=8080`.
4. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain**, port `8080`.
5. Copy the setup key from the **Deploy Logs**.

### Deployed from GitHub and it crashed?

Deploying the repo from GitHub creates only the app, with no database. The
logs then say **No database is connected** (older versions crashed with
`ECONNREFUSED ... 127.0.0.1:5432`). To fix it:

1. In the project, **+ Create → Database → PostgreSQL**.
2. In the app service's **Variables** tab, add
   `DATABASE_URL` = `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (type it exactly; Railway
   fills in the real value. If your database service isn't called `Postgres`,
   use its name).
3. Railway redeploys. Look for the setup key in the **Deploy Logs**.

Make sure the app and the database are in the same project and environment.

**Still `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432`, or "DATABASE_URL points at localhost"?**
`DATABASE_URL` holds a local-development value, often because Railway's
**Suggested Variables** (read from `.env.example`) were added. In the app
service's **Variables** tab:
- set `DATABASE_URL` to `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (not
  `postgresql://blst:blst@localhost...`);
- delete `PORT` if it says `3000` (Railway sets the port itself);
- check the Postgres service is really named `Postgres`; otherwise use its name
  in the reference.

The deploy log prints `Database: <host>:5432/railway` when it's right; the host
ends in `.railway.internal`.

## After deploying

**Sign-in codes are written to the Deploy Logs** until email and text
messages are set up, so you can create the first admin straight away. In the
service's **Deploy Logs**, look for lines like:

```
[dev email to you@example.com] 123456 is your BLST code
[dev sms to +15551234567] Your BLST code is 123456. It expires in 10 min. …
```

Each code works for 10 minutes; asking again sends a new one.

### Real email and texts

**Email: Resend** (recommended on Railway: it sends over HTTPS, and Railway
allows outbound SMTP only on Pro plans and above).
1. Sign up at resend.com and add your domain (e.g. `beerleaguestats.hockey`);
   add the DNS records it shows and wait for it to verify.
2. Create an API key (sending access).
3. Set `RESEND_API_KEY=re_...` and `EMAIL_FROM='Beer League Stats <no-reply@beerleaguestats.hockey>'`
   (the address must be on the verified domain).

On a Pro plan any SMTP service also works: `SMTP_URL='smtps://USER:PASS@smtp.example.com:465'`.

**Texts: Twilio Verify** (recommended: Twilio sends the codes from its own
registered numbers, so no A2P 10DLC or toll-free registration).
1. In the Twilio Console: **Verify → Services → Create new**. Name it
   `Beer League Stats`, tick **SMS**, and copy the **Service SID** (`VA...`).
2. Set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and
   `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=VA...`.

The start-up log then says `Text messages: Twilio Verify`. Trial accounts
can only text numbers verified in Twilio; upgrade before real users sign up.
(Sending from your own number with `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` also works, but US
carriers require A2P 10DLC or toll-free registration for it.)

```bash
railway variable set --service blst RESEND_API_KEY=re_... EMAIL_FROM='Beer League Stats <no-reply@beerleaguestats.hockey>'
railway variable set --service blst TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC... TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=... TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=VA...
```

Without the CLI, write `npx @railway/cli` instead of `railway`, or use the
service's **Variables** tab. Variable changes made in the dashboard are
*staged*: click **Deploy** on the banner at the top of the canvas to apply them.

**Checking it:** each start logs `Email: Resend API, from …` (or `SMTP host:465`)
and every email logs `email sent via … to j•••@…`. If you see neither, the
variables haven't reached the running deployment. A sign-in for an email with no
account sends nothing (on purpose); the log says so with
`[auth] sign-in for …: no account with that email`. On a new install use
**Set up admin**, not **Sign in**. Once a channel has a provider, its codes are
sent and never logged. If sending fails, the reason is in the Deploy Logs
(`email send failed: …` or `sms send failed: …`). When both work, set
`AUTH_LOG_CODES=false`.

Optional:
- LeagueApps variables (see the README), which also import every LeagueApps
  member into their faction (they belong to one organization:
  `LEAGUEAPPS_ORG_ID`, default the first);
- your own domain, with an address per organization (next section).

## Organizations on their own addresses

One `blst` service serves every organization. The bare domain is the platform
(sign up, ask for an organization, approvals) and each organization lives at
`<org>.<domain>`, with `/stats`, `/factions` and `/admin` pages.

1. In the service's **Settings → Networking → Custom Domain**, add
   `beerleaguestats.hockey` **and** `*.beerleaguestats.hockey`.
2. At your DNS provider, add exactly the records Railway shows for each: a
   CNAME for the bare domain (or ALIAS/ANAME/flattened CNAME, which most DNS
   providers offer at the root), a CNAME for `*`, the `_acme-challenge` CNAME
   that lets Railway issue the wildcard certificate, and the TXT verification
   records. If you use Cloudflare, set the records to **DNS only** (grey
   cloud) until the certificates are issued.
3. Set the variable:
   ```bash
   railway variable set --service blst APP_DOMAIN=beerleaguestats.hockey
   ```

Then:
- `https://beerleaguestats.hockey` is the platform. Sign in there with the
  admin account you set up and open **Platform admin** to approve organizations.
- Your first organization is `blpa`: `https://blpa.beerleaguestats.hockey/stats`.
  Rename it or change its address under Platform admin.
- New organizations ask at the platform; you get an email for each one.
- Railway's own `*.up.railway.app` address shows the platform. Set
  `DEFAULT_ORG=blpa` to make it show an organization instead.

Leave `APP_DOMAIN` unset to run a single league on any address.

Admin → **Security** shows the live security posture. It should be all ✓ once
email and SMS are set up.

## What BLST sets up by itself

| | Without a config var | To set it yourself |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup key** for the first admin | Printed in the log at each start until the first admin exists (one-time; only its hash is stored) | `ADMIN_TOKEN` |
| **Code-signing secret** | Generated on first start, kept in the database | `AUTH_SECRET` |
| **Least-privilege database login** | Created at start as `blst_app` (rows only, no schema changes). Requests run as it; migrations use the owner login. Its password is derived, never stored | `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` plus `npm run db:app-role`, which keeps the owner login out of the running app entirely. Opt out with `DB_AUTO_APP_ROLE=false` |
| **Client address** for rate limits | Read from Railway's `X-Real-IP` | `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` |

## Already running the two-app setup?

If you deployed with an earlier version of this script (separate `blst` and
`factions` services), upgrade like this:

1. Redeploy `blst` from the updated branch. It imports the Factions data from
   the shared database once. Look for `Factions import:` in the logs.
2. Delete the `factions` service.
3. In `blst`'s Variables tab, delete `FACTIONS_BASE_URL`, `FACTIONS_ADMIN_TOKEN`
   and `FACTIONS_AUTO_SYNC`.

Your existing `ADMIN_TOKEN` and `AUTH_SECRET` keep working, so leave them.

## Good to know

- **Branch:** the script and button deploy `claude/great-bardeen-wfd39q`. After
  merging, use `BLST_BRANCH=main npm run railway`, or change the branch in the
  service's Settings.
- **Build settings:** none to fill in. `railpack.json` tells Railway's builder
  how to start the app. Railway's older `railway.json` is deprecated, so it
  isn't used.
- **Nothing is ever open by default:** with nothing configured, every change
  needs an admin, and the only way to create the first admin is the setup key
  from the log plus email and text codes.
- **Keep `blst` at one replica:** live scores are shared in memory.
- **Sign-in is per address:** browsers keep the sign-in for each organization's
  address separately, so people sign in on each one they use.
